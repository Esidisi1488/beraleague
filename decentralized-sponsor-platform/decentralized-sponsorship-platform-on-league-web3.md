# Decentralized Sponsorship Platform on League Web3

On the League Web3 platform, we offer an entirely new approach to sponsorship using blockchain and smart contracts to create a decentralized sponsorship platform that solves the problems of the traditional model. Sponsors can contribute funds directly through the blockchain, and smart contracts ensure transparency and automation of all processes.

### Transparency and Security of Transactions

Every sponsor transaction is recorded on the blockchain, making the sponsorship process fully transparent and open to all participants. Sponsors can be confident that their funds are directed precisely to the support of the tournaments for which they were allocated. Thanks to smart contracts, sponsorship becomes secure, and the risk of fraud is minimized, as transactions are automatically executed when predefined conditions are met.

### Automatic Distribution of Sponsorship Funds

Sponsorship support is managed by smart contracts that automatically distribute funds between tournament organizers and winners. This eliminates the need for intermediaries and significantly speeds up the fund distribution process. Sponsors can set specific conditions for their contributions, such as directing funds only to tournaments with certain participants or specific prize pools.

### Interaction Mechanisms for Sponsors and Players

The decentralized sponsorship platform allows sponsors to directly interact with players and viewers. Sponsors can offer special bonuses or rewards for tournament participants, including exclusive NFTs or in-game items. Sponsors can also use their support to host special events or challenges within tournaments, increasing audience engagement and making their brands more visible.

### Support for Small and Medium Sponsors

The League Web3 platform is open to sponsors of all levels, including small companies and independent investors. Sponsors can contribute small amounts to support tournaments, gaining the right to participate in event promotion and brand visibility in return. This decentralized model makes sponsorship more accessible and flexible, allowing anyone to contribute to tournament development and benefit from their support.

### Sponsor Opportunities on the League Web3 Platform

Sponsors will be able to choose different levels of participation in tournaments, from small contributions to maintain prize pools to full sponsorship of tournaments. Depending on the level of sponsorship, sponsors will receive various bonuses, including brand promotion during the tournament, logo placement, and active interaction with players and viewers.

### NFTs for Sponsors

The League Web3 platform will also offer unique NFTs for sponsors, allowing them to receive bonuses in the form of advertising opportunities and exclusive access to tournament information. These NFTs may provide the following advantages:

* Advertising space at the tournament and on the platform.
* Access to tournament statistics and analytics to improve marketing strategies.
* The ability to participate in platform development and tournament format votes.

### Personalized Sponsorship Proposals

Sponsors will be able to develop personalized offers for tournament participants. For example, they may offer special rewards for winners, exclusive discounts on products or services, or even organize joint campaigns with NFT projects.

### Decentralized Sponsor Voting

The platform may implement a voting system where sponsors with certain NFTs can influence the selection of games for tournaments, their formats, and other important aspects. This will increase their engagement and give them more control over the sponsored events.
