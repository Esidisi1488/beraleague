# Problems with Centralized Sponsorship

In traditional centralized platforms, sponsorship faces several limitations:

<mark style="color:green;">**Lack of Transparency:**</mark> Sponsors cannot always track how their funds are used or the impact of their support on the audience and tournament participants.

<mark style="color:green;">**Limited Opportunities for Small and Medium Sponsors:**</mark> Large sponsors often take key positions, leaving limited space for small and medium-sized companies to participate.

<mark style="color:green;">**Complex and Slow Processes:**</mark> In the traditional sponsorship model, many intermediaries and administrative procedures are required, which slows down the process and makes it less efficient.

<mark style="color:green;">**Less Audience Engagement:**</mark> Due to the centralized structure, sponsors cannot always directly interact with players and viewers, which limits engagement.
