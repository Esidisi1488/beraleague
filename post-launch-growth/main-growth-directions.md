# Main Growth Directions

### Expanding the Game List&#x20;

One of our first tasks after launch will be to expand the list of games available for tournaments on the platform. In addition to popular games like Dota 2, CS2, Valorant, Apex Legends, and Fortnite, we will integrate new games based on user preferences and market trends. This will attract more players and expand the platform’s audience.

In the future, we plan to include games such as:

* Call of Duty <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt="" data-size="line"> — one of the most popular shooter franchises.&#x20;
* PUBG <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt="" data-size="line"> — a battle royale game that continues to attract millions of players.&#x20;
* Rocket League <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png" alt="" data-size="line"> — a dynamic arcade game popular among esports players and viewers.&#x20;
* League of Legends <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt="" data-size="line"> — another iconic MOBA game that can attract a large player base.
