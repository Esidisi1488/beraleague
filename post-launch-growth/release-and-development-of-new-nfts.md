# Release and Development of New NFTs

After the platform launch, we will continue to develop the NFT ecosystem. We plan to release new NFT collections that will offer unique benefits to their holders, such as:

<mark style="color:green;">**Early access to exclusive tournaments:**</mark> Holders of specific NFTs will be able to participate in closed tournaments with higher prize pools and fewer participants.&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">**Additional bonuses and rewards:**</mark> NFTs can offer bonus rewards for tournament victories and discounts on participation in future events.

<mark style="color:green;">**Sponsorship opportunities:**</mark> Sponsors will be able to use NFTs to promote their brands on the platform, creating unique assets tied to their involvement in tournaments.
