# Smart Contracts and Their Role in Tournament Organization

Smart contracts are the key technology that makes decentralized tournaments possible. They perform the following functions:

<mark style="color:green;">**Record Keeping:**</mark> Match results are recorded on the blockchain via smart contracts, guaranteeing their immutability.

<mark style="color:green;">**Prize Distribution:**</mark> As soon as the tournament ends, smart contracts automatically distribute prizes to the winners based on the set conditions. An example of how smart contracts work:

Players register for the tournament and submit participation fees in cryptocurrency. The tournament begins, and match results are automatically updated on the blockchain. After the tournament ends, the smart contract checks the results, and the prize pool is instantly distributed to the winners.

### Ability to Propose Own Tournaments

One of the unique aspects of the League Web3 platform is the ability for players and third-party organizers to propose and host their own tournaments. Using ready-made smart contracts, any user can create a tournament with unique conditions, such as a specific game, competition type, and prize pool. This opens doors for numerous independent tournaments and stimulates the creative development of the esports community.
