# Growth Projections for the Platform

### User Base Growth&#x20;

According to forecasts, the League Web3 platform could reach tens of thousands of active users in its first year after launch. This will be possible thanks to a well-planned marketing strategy, partnerships with gaming communities, and the use of innovative technologies such as NFT and blockchain.

### Increase in the Number of Tournaments

We expect a significant increase in the number of tournaments held. In the first months after launch, several major tournaments will be organized, attracting a wide audience. As the platform grows, the number of tournaments will increase, offering users more opportunities to participate and win.

### NFT Ecosystem Growth&#x20;

The NFT ecosystem on the League Web3 platform is expected to grow rapidly. NFT holders will gain unique benefits, and the tokens will accumulate value as the platform functionality expands. We plan to support the growth of the NFT market through regular releases of new collections and marketplace development.
