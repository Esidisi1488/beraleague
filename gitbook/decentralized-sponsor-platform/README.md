# Decentralized Sponsor Platform

Sponsorship has always played a crucial role in the development of esports events and tournaments. Traditional esports platforms often offer limited opportunities for brands and companies wishing to support tournaments. However, the use of decentralized technologies opens new opportunities for sponsors, providing transparency, security, and new interaction mechanisms. The League Web3 platform creates an innovative decentralized sponsorship platform, allowing sponsors to effectively participate in tournaments, while players benefit from their support.
