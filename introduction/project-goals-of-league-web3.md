# Project Goals of League Web3

1. Create a platform that ensures full transparency for all tournaments and their outcomes through blockchain technology.
2. Introduce NFTs to offer players unique benefits and opportunities to personalize their participation in competitions.
3. Open new opportunities for sponsors by providing them access to a decentralized ecosystem where they can safely and transparently support tournaments.
4. Ensure a low barrier to entry for participants so that every player can easily join a tournament and compete for prizes. The introduction of League Web3 into the world of esports through blockchain and NFTs is set to significantly transform the market, making it fairer, more open, and attractive for all participants. We believe that our platform will become the new standard for hosting tournaments in the Web3 era.
