# Partnerships with Esports Organizations

The League Web3 platform will aim to partner with major esports organizations, teams, and tournaments. These partnerships will help attract the attention of both professional players and viewers who actively follow esports events. Sponsoring major tournaments and collaborating with popular teams will strengthen the brand and position League Web3 as a leading platform in the esports and Web3 sectors.

### Influencer Marketing

One of the promotion strategies will involve working with gaming influencers and crypto influencers, who can demonstrate the use of the platform and its benefits. These opinion leaders will help communicate the value of using League Web3, including participating in tournaments, using NFTs, and interacting with decentralized mechanisms. Regular streams with popular players, reviews of tournaments and events on the platform will help create interest and increase engagement.
